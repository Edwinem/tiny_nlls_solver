# Tiny Solver


This is a small non-liner least squares solver. I created it cause I found myself creating an ugly hack version when trying to implement dense visual slam problems.
A good amount of this project derives from the tiny solver in Ceres.

The base of this tiny solver comes from the tiny solver in Ceres. Also I took their cost functions design and autodiff to make certain things easier.
